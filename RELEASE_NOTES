MICA v0.40

- contributions by Hamid Fadishei:
    * append_pid config entry added by Hamid Fadishei, mainly for multiprocess binaries
    * some warning messages resolved

MICA v0.32

- significant code cleanup by Petr Tuma; notes:
        * cleaned up some redundant NULL pointer casts
        * cleaned up names of LRU stack entry references
        * systematic testing of malloc return value in most of the tool code
        * added warning on presence of multiple threads
        * replaced sprintf with string streams
	* added branch prediction hints using __builtin_expect where appropriate
- guard tracking progress in mica_progress.txt with a preprocessor flag (-DVERBOSE)
- test MICA built using the Intel C++ compiler, and document how to build it using
  icpc in the README (TODO: benchmark the performance difference)

MICA v0.31

- improved config file parsing, i.e. remove dependency on order of entries

- updated README file
	- describe some details regarding instruction mix

MICA v0.3

- increased flexibility of itypes analysis significantly
        - instruction groups used in itypes analysis can be specified by the user now,
          using a itypes.spec file; specify the filename in mica.conf using an entry like:
                itypes_spec_file: <filename>
        - by default, the old instruction groups are used
          (except for SYSCALL, which was added to the group formely known as 'other')
- made block size in ilp, memfootprint and memreusedist flexible
        - size can be set by specifying 'block_size: <power of 2>' in the mica.conf file
        - default block size is 2^6 (64) bytes, which is a change compared to MICA v0.23 for ilp
- made page size in memfootprint flexible
        - size can be set by specifying 'page_size: <power of 2>' in the mica.conf file
        - default page size is 4096 (2^12) bytes
- possibly expensive assert statements and other sanity checks were removed
- bug fixes:
        - memory read size wasn't being used 100% correctly
          in ilp, memfootprint, memreusedist and stride analysis,
          the size was being added to the start address of the read,
          while (size-1) should be added; otherwise, e.g. for memfootprint,
          we count an extra block being touched if the access is near a block boundary
        - a small problem with an assert statement was fixed in memfootprint (>= 0 instead of >)
        - fprintf statements were fixed for 64-bit systems

MICA v0.23

Several people have reported small problems when MICA is being used with
recent Pin kits. This small patch release should resolve these issues.

- bug fixes:
        * adjusted makefile and README according to Pin kit directory tree changes
        * adjust mica_itypes.cpp to recognize both NOP and WIDENOP categories

MICA v0.22

- bug fixes in itypes:
	* fixed issue with instructions in MISC category being counted double (both in 'control flow' and 'other' buckets)
	  (thanks to Ahmed S. Al-Zawawi for bringing my attention to this issue)
	* added NOP instructions category
- adjusted README file to make meaning of different buckets in memreusedist more clear
  (thanks to Kshitij Sudan for reporting this)

May 20th 2008
--------------

MICA v0.21

- removed -static from makefile, to avoid issues when linking MICA
  (thanks to J. K. Rai and Ahmed S. Al-Zawawi for reporting this)

Dec. 3rd 2007
--------------

MICA v0.2:

- various bug fixes, including:
 	* reg: include non-full-width registers
	* ilp: not all registers were included in analysis (stopped after first non-valid register)
	* stride: fixed faulty use of readIndex/writeIndex in readMem/writeMem
	* reset interval_ins_count for all characteristics
- added features:
	* taking size of memory read/write into account
	* implementation of memreusedist characteristics, useful for characterizing cache behavior
- adjusted:
	* memory footprint measured for 64-byte blocks instead of 32-byte blocks (because most modern processors have 64-byte cache blocks)
	* configuring MICA is done using a mica.conf configuration file instead of command line parameters
- speed:
	* used InsertIfCall/InsertThenCall to make more analysis routines inlineable
	* buffering for ilp implementation, which yields roughly 10% speedup

Initial release: MICA v0.1
